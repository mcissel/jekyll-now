I was using Ubuntu for a while and I like it, but it wasn't quite the Windows 7 that I'd gotten used to. Now I went and upgraded to Windows 8.1 and I like that too, BELIEVE IT! The tiles are pretty cool. Fuck what ya heard about it being a pain in the ass. It's just an optional awesomeness. But I digress.

So I had to get Visual Studio for a new job, hence the need for Windows. Then, I wanted to use Meteor again, and Meteor doesn't yet play nice with Windows for making mobile apps, hence the need for Ubunut. My favorite.
