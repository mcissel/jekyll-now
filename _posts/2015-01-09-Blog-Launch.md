title: Blog Launch!

I forked Barry Clark's "jekyll-now" repository to create my own Github blog. After 30 seconds of setup, and a few minutes of wondering why it wasn't working (the URL didn't display my blog), I let it sit and waited.

After a few hours or maybe a day, I went to mcissel.github.io and now I've got my very own Github blog!

:point_up:Achaa!
