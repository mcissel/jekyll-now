I'm a programmer currently seeking employment or even part time work. I've earned a 3.91 GPA in Bioengineering (Biocomputation focus) part time while I've started a career as a web developer and all around programmer.

I've been programming Javascript since back in 2003, when Firefox was called Netscape. I've been an Android enthusiast since the Google Phone in 2008. I still have my original G1. I've rooted all of them, and I program for the Android as well.

I started my professional career as a web developer using content management systems like Drupal and Wordpress. That would inevitably lead me to learn PHP, where my many years of learning OOP Java in school came in handy. I was doing mostly front end work for a while, so I got a lot more Javascript experience and gained a real appreciation for the simplicity of JSON. Besides web development, I've also programmed in C, Simulink, and Labview.

Lately, I've been learning about and experimenting with other languages and frameworks like CakePHP, Node.js, and Ruby on Rails. I've also made a chrome extension, which you can see here [https://github.com/mcissel/checkall-chrome-ext] (https://github.com/mcissel/checkall-chrome-ext)
