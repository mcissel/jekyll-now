I'm a programmer currently seeking employment or even part time work.

I've been programming for the web since Firefox was named Netscape. Lately, I've been learning about and experimenting with other languages and frameworks like CakePHP, Node.js, and Ruby on Rails. I've also made a chrome extension, which you can see here [https://github.com/mcissel/checkall-chrome-ext](https://github.com/mcissel/checkall-chrome-ext)
